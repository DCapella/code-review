# Code Review
Code review for Accruent.

## Problems chosen
In choosing the 3 problems I started with the first ones. However, these proved too simple so I used
a random generator from Python.

```python
import numpy as np

print(np.random.randint(664, size=3))
```

One of the problems 193, I was able to solve for minor numbers but on large numbers, I could not
simplify it enough. I still included it for looks.

On 72, I included my previous tries for informational purposes.
